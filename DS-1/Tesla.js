/**
 * Problem Description
Tesla is testing their new car which they will be launching soon. The driver of the car started recording the speed of the car. Letâ€™s assume he always starts with a speed of 1500. Whenever his speed changed, he recorded this change in an array. This array is given to you as input. You have to return a result array with two numbers - the highest speed he ever reached and his final speed.


Input format
First line contains an integer n.

Second line contains n space separated integers.


Output format
Return an array with 2 integers


Sample Input 1
5

100 -200 350 100 -600


Sample Output 1
1850 1250

  let res = [];
  res[0] = 1500 + diffs[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < diffs.length; i++) {
    res[i] = res[i - 1] + diffs[i];
    max = Math.max(max, res[i]);
  }

  return [max, res[res.length - 1]];
}

let diffs = [100, -200, 350, 100, -600];

console.log("Tesla speeds : " + tesla(diffs,5));
